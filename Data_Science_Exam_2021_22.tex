In order to evaluate the effect of a drug over a disease a pharmaceutical company wants to perform a study comparing the effect of the drug with placebo. The drug and the placebo will be delivered to both male and female patients to verify any possible different response of the two sexes. The effect of the drug will be measured in 10th of reduction of any of the 5 possible symptoms of the disease. How many factors and dependent variables this analysis has? Which are they?

In a hospital a research is carried out with the aim to identify the best rehabilitation technique after knee surgery. The doctors want to compare three different devices against a standard expert physiotherapist. The efficacy of the rehabilitation is estimated by the measurement of the degrees of flexion of the knee. Which series of test would you suggest to the medical team? Explain your answer.

A company develops an application that estimates how long it takes for users to drive to work. To do so, the company collects data of users driving to work, recording the initial and final location of the drive, and the time of day at the beginning and at the end. Formalize this as a supervised learning problem. Which are the concrete components of this learning problem?
